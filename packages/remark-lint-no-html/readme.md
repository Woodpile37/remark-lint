## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin, specifically a `remark-lint`
rule.
Lint rules check markdown code style.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package to check that no HTML (other than comments) is used.

## Presets

This rule is not included in a preset maintained here.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-no-html
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import remarkLintNoHtml from 'https://esm.sh/remark-lint-no-html@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkLintNoHtml from 'https://esm.sh/remark-lint-no-html@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

On the API:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
import remarkLintNoHtml from 'remark-lint-no-html'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkLint)
    .use(remarkLintNoHtml)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.error(reporter(file))
}
```

On the CLI:

```sh
remark --use remark-lint --use remark-lint-no-html example.md
```

On the CLI in a config file (here a `package.json`):

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "remark-lint",
+    "remark-lint-no-html",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkLintNoHtml`.

### `unified().use(remarkLintNoHtml[, config])`

This rule supports standard configuration that all remark lint rules accept
(such as `false` to turn it off or `[1, options]` to configure it).

There are no options.

## Examples

##### `ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
# Hello

<!--Comments are also OK-->
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
<h1>Hello</h1>
```

###### Out

```text
1:1-1:15: Do not use HTML in markdown
```
